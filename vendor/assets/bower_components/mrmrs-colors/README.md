# COLORS

# Better colors for the web.

View the project page at [http://clrs.cc](http://clrs.cc "Colors: Redefining the default web colors.")

# What is this?

A simple color palette for the web. Out of the box, the color strings that css provides aren't... the tops.
This is a set of sass variables and css classes that should help fix that.

## Getting started

* Grab a copy of the code by downloading the zip from this page - or cloning/forking the repo.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:mrmrs/colors.git
```

### Using the css
Simply copy colors.css to your css directory and include the file like so in the head of your html document

``` <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/colors.css"> ```

### Using the Sass
The sass source can be found in a folder I creatively titled "sass."
Include any or all of the three partials to your project like you would any other
sass partials. But just for reference...

```
@import "variables";
@import "skins";
@import "links";
```

### Using the Stylus
You an also edit the source code as stylus.
Include, exclude, or modify the partials to your hearts content.
