    <p>
    The list of groups in the drop-down marked &quot;Select a group&quot; is a list of User Managed Groups that you are a member of, and are managed by <%=t('sufia.institution_name') %>'s ITS department.  You may select a specific group and assign an access
    level for a file within <%=t('sufia.product_name') %>, similarly to adding user access levels.  However, management of these groups and their membership is handled centrally at <a href="http://umg.its.psu.edu" target="_blank">umg.its.psu.edu</a>.
